In a land of misplaced evils<br />
There dwelt a creature named Spitfire,<br />
Who was aptly named,<br />
Did spit fire for<br />
All the world to see.<br />
News of this flame<br />
Had reached across the lands.<br />
The flame was hot in some lands<br />
While familiar in others.<br />
It did melt the ice in some<br />
Brought new life to ground.<br />
While in others still,<br />
It'd burnt weeds in the field.<br />
<br />
This land haply, fierce weeds had bounded<br />
And kept them safe.<br />
So thought the insular aborigines.<br />
But Spitfire flew above and saw<br />
Them in their misery,<br />
For had they rivers flowing,<br />
Beyond the bound of weeds<br />
Whose waters be used to tend<br />
And fish be caught to eat.<br />
For had they maples and oaks<br />
Beyond the denizens tranquil,<br />
Whose wood be used to shelter<br />
And shade be used to rest.<br />
The creatures all not happy,<br />
But Spitfire wasn't unwary<br />
And flew higher than ever.<br />
<br />
Still this wasn't quite,<br />
For this new boundless land,<br />
Had new designs been drawn,<br />
And fashioned an oaken bow.<br />
They shot good Spitfire down,<br />
With a bow mounted on an oak.<br />
They caught and tied him up<br />
And accused him<br />
Of exposing this land<br />
To the tyranny of the unknown,<br />
Of exposing indigenes<br />
To worlds beyond the weeds.<br />
But Spitfire did fight back,<br />
Did so knowingly in vain.<br />
This enraged the creatures<br />
Who set about as tyrants.<br />
<br />
They skinned strong Spitfire<br />
And made fireproof armours.<br />
They drank his blood and ate his flesh,<br />
Fenced their land with his bones.<br />
And set out in search,<br />
For more of his kind.<br />
Some for his blood, some for his flesh<br />
And some for his fireproof skin.<br />
But some set out in search<br />
Of his fire and its fuel.<br />
Others who stayed - some lit<br />
Their homes with his flames,<br />
Some the streets, on the misplaced evils.<br />
So he did not die in vain,<br />
And someday of the legend of<br />
Spitfire, the world will know<br />
And thus Spitfire The Great he will be dubbed,<br />
Who martyred for creatures unknown.<br />
