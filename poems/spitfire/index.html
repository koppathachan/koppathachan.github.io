In a land of misplaced evils<br>
There dwelt a creature named Spitfire,<br>
Who was aptly named,<br>
Did spit fire for<br>
All the world to see.<br>
News of this flame<br>
Had reached across the lands.<br>
The flame was hot in some lands<br>
While familiar in others.<br>
It did melt the ice in some<br>
Brought new life to ground.<br>
While in others still,<br>
It'd burnt weeds in the field.<br>
<br>
This land haply, fierce weeds had bounded<br>
And kept them safe.<br>
So thought the insular aborigines.<br>
But Spitfire flew above and saw<br>
Them in their misery,<br>
For had they rivers flowing,<br>
Beyond the bound of weeds<br>
Whose waters be used to tend<br>
And fish be caught to eat.<br>
For had they maples and oaks<br>
Beyond the denizens tranquil,<br>
Whose wood be used to shelter<br>
And shade be used to rest.<br>
The creatures all not happy,<br>
But Spitfire wasn't unwary<br>
And flew higher than ever.<br>
<br>
Still this wasn't quite,<br>
For this new boundless land,<br>
Had new designs been drawn,<br>
And fashioned an oaken bow.<br>
They shot good Spitfire down,<br>
With a bow mounted on an oak.<br>
They caught and tied him up<br>
And accused him<br>
Of exposing this land<br>
To the tyranny of the unknown,<br>
Of exposing indigenes<br>
To worlds beyond the weeds.<br>
But Spitfire did fight back,<br>
Did so knowingly in vain.<br>
This enraged the creatures<br>
Who set about as tyrants.<br>
<br>
They skinned strong Spitfire<br>
And made fireproof armours.<br>
They drank his blood and ate his flesh,<br>
Fenced their land with his bones.<br>
And set out in search,<br>
For more of his kind.<br>
Some for his blood, some for his flesh<br>
And some for his fireproof skin.<br>
But some set out in search<br>
Of his fire and its fuel.<br>
Others who stayed - some lit<br>
Their homes with his flames,<br>
Some the streets, on the misplaced evils.<br>
So he did not die in vain,<br>
And someday of the legend of<br>
Spitfire, the world will know<br>
And thus Spitfire The Great he will be dubbed,<br>
Who martyred for creatures unknown.<br>
