      <description>Currying is the transformation of a function written like this
1 2  const add = (a, b) =&amp;gt; a+b; add(3, 4) // = 7   
Into this
1 2  const add = a =&amp;gt; b =&amp;gt; a+b; add(3)(4) // = 7   
Which allows me to do this.
1 2 3  const add = a =&amp;gt; b =&amp;gt; a+b; const add3 = add(3); // this can be read as 3 + b;  add3(1) // = 4</description>

      <description>I’ve been going through some functional programming concepts because I’m on a quest to write better code, and someone told me functional programming is the way to go. I was intrigued and so, I read about it and found out that it was based on lambda calculus and was even more intrigued because it said “calculus”.
The mathematical definition of a function is &amp;lsquo;a relationship between two sets of values such that every element in the first set has a unique value in the second set&amp;rsquo;.</description>
