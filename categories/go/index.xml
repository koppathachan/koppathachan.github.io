      <title>Using interfaces in golang to write testable code</title>

      <description>I like golang&amp;rsquo;s interfaces. They&amp;rsquo;re just a bunch of function signatures. Simple. Any user-defined type can satisfy multiple interface types at once. Which is why I could easily read a file and pass that to my function that takes an io.Reader interface. *os.File implements the Read(b []byte) (int, error).
 1 2 3 4  // the io.Reader interface type Reader interface { Read(p []byte) (int, error) }</description>

      <description>November 10th, 2019 marked the 10th anniversary of this awesome programming language called Go. The Go community in Bangalore organized a meetup (which was also their 50th meetup) hosted by SAP Labs. The meetup introduced me to gRPC and writing custom plugins for gRPC. The meetup also introduced me to how the Go runtime scheduler works and how it has achieved high performance concurrency. I was just a beginner in Go and starting to fall in love with the language, and knowing the genesis story of Go helped me understand some of the weirdness I felt about the language initially.</description>
