      <description>&amp;#39;Brevity is the soul of wit&amp;#39;   We owe shakespeare the credit for this enduring idiom. The context of this quote if often lost in its contemporary usage. I too, am going to ignore it and use it to simply mean intelligence or humour is best expressed briefly. I am also going to extend this quality, &amp;#39;soul of wit&amp;#39;, to programming.  The best thing about free and open source software is that there is a lot of good, clean usefull software to choose from to do anything.</description>

      <title>Memoization, with a js implementation that caches recursive calls.</title>

      <description>Memoization is an optimization technique used in functional programming to speed up execution by storing the results of resource expensive function calls. When the function is called again with the same input the stored result is fetched and returned. This is possible in functional programming languages because of the use of pure functions as discussed in this post. Purely functional languages such as Haskell has inbuilt support for memoization. In javascript, using a mutable map (object, map, caches) we can implement a memoization.</description>

      <description>I’ve been going through some functional programming concepts because I’m on a quest to write better code, and someone told me functional programming is the way to go. I was intrigued and so, I read about it and found out that it was based on lambda calculus and was even more intrigued because it said “calculus”.  The mathematical definition of a function is &amp;#39;a relationship between two sets of values such that every element in the first set has a unique value in the second set&amp;#39;.</description>

      <title>Why Currying</title>
      <link>https://akhilsasidharan.in/posts/why-curry/</link>

      <description>Currying is the transformation of a function written like this const add = (a, b) =&amp;gt; a+b; add(3, 4) // = 7    Into this const add = a =&amp;gt; b =&amp;gt; a+b; add(3)(4) // = 7    Which allows me to do this. const add = a =&amp;gt; b =&amp;gt; a+b; const add3 = add(3); // this can be read as 3 + b;  add3(1) // = 4    Here I partially applied 3 to the function add to get add3 a specific function that adds 3 to its input.</description>

      <title>Go. Weird And Awesome.</title>

      <description>November 10th, 2019 marked the 10th anniversary of this awesome programming language called Go. The Go community in Bangalore organized a meetup (which was also their 50th meetup) hosted by SAP Labs. The meetup introduced me to gRPC and writing custom plugins for gRPC. The meetup also introduced me to how the Go runtime scheduler works and how it has achieved high performance concurrency. I was just a beginner in Go and starting to fall in love with the language, and knowing the genesis story of Go helped me understand some of the weirdness I felt about the language initially.</description>
